"""The formal-companion annotation format: schema checks, id rules, canonical form.

The format is specified in docs/annotations.md and its JSON Schema is
schema/annotations-v1.0.schema.json (one file per format minor; schema_version
"1.0"), which a wheel ships as this package's ``schema/``.  ``validate`` is
the checker (and a CLI) and the RFC 8785 canonicaliser, ``schemacheck`` the
small JSON Schema evaluator it runs, because this package is standard library
only, ``ids`` the format's mechanical id rules (statement hashes of anonymous
declarations, passage and label ids), and ``vocab`` the format's enums and id
grammar.

The submodules are not imported here, so ``python3 -m
formal_companion_annotations.validate`` runs without a double import.
